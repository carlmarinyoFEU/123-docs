It was kind of like the Type R STI, but improved in all the important areas. The original car used the 2.0-litre Boxer engine like that in the rally car, but for the 22B it was bored out to 2.2-litres. It also got other improvements, such as nozzles to spray water into the intercooler when driving hard. </p>

The basic specifications followed in the footstep of the LANCER EVOLUTION V, but the biggest difference was in its aerodynamic package. Based on the requirements needed for the rally car, the LANCER EVOLUTION VI adopted a two-stage rear wing installed on the standard version to start with. </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="200">The Audi Quattro was the first rally car to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules that allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing. It won consecutive competitions for the next two years.[4] To commemorate the success of the original vehicle, all subsequent Audi production automobiles with this four-wheel-drive system were badged with the trademark quattro with a lower case "q" letter.</p>
